Task 1
Directory: Task_1.ipynb

Description For this task:
Build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived the disaster. This beginner-friendly project uses easily accessible data containing various passenger details, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 2
Directory: Task_2.ipynb

Description For this task:
Create a Python-based movie rating prediction system. This project aims to develop a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques will be employed to address this challenge.

The objective is to analyze historical movie data and construct a model capable of accurately estimating the rating assigned to a movie by users or critics.

The Movie Rating Prediction project offers an opportunity to delve into data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It facilitates the exploration of factors influencing movie ratings and enables the construction of a reliable model for rating estimation.

Task 3
Directory: Task_3.ipynb

Description For this task:
Develop a machine learning model with the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on measurements of their sepals and petals. This dataset contains three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, discernible by their specific measurements. Your goal is to train a machine learning algorithm to learn from these measurements and precisely classify iris flowers into their appropriate species. This dataset is commonly used for introductory classification tasks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 4
Directory: Task_4.ipynb

Description For this task:
Predict future sales using Python! This project involves forecasting product quantities customers will buy, considering factors like advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. Data Scientists play a vital role, utilizing Python's machine learning to analyze data, informing decisions on advertising costs. Join us on this journey of sales prediction!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 5
Directory: Task_5.ipynb

Description For this task:
Create a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize transaction data, address class imbalance, and split the dataset for training and testing. Train a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression or random forests) to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and explore techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to enhance results.
