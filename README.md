Task 1
Task 2
Task 3
Task 4
Task 5


Task 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: 
Task_1.ipynb

Description For this task:
Build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived the disaster. This beginner-friendly project uses easily accessible data containing various passenger details, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.


Task 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: 
Task_2.ipynb

Description For this task:
Create a Python movie rating prediction system. This project aims to forecast movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors, using regression techniques. Analyze historical movie data to build a model that accurately estimates ratings by users or critics. This project explores data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling, providing insights into factors influencing movie ratings.

Task 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: 
Task_3.ipynb

Description For this task:
Develop a machine learning model with the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on measurements of their sepals and petals. This dataset contains three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, discernible by their specific measurements. Your goal is to train a machine learning algorithm to learn from these measurements and precisely classify iris flowers into their appropriate species. This dataset is commonly used for introductory classification tasks.


Task 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: 
Task_4.ipynb

Description For this task:
Predict future sales using Python! This project involves forecasting product quantities customers will buy, considering factors like advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. Data Scientists play a vital role, utilizing Python's machine learning to analyze data, informing decisions on advertising costs. Join us on this journey of sales prediction!


Task 5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: 
Task_5.ipynb

Description For this task:
Create a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize transaction data, address class imbalance, and split the dataset for training and testing. Train a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression or random forests) to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and explore techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to enhance results.
